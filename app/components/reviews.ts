        review: "Having lived in the Middle East for 20 years, I can confidently vouch for Yemen Gate as one of the most authentic Yemeni-style mandi spots in Ottawa. The lamb mandi features exceptionally tender meat that effortlessly falls off the bone, enhanced by juicy fat that adds incredible flavor. The rice is lightly spiced and aromatic, creating a perfect combination. This mandi boasts subtle, balanced flavors, complemented by fried onions and nuts, and is served with a delightful minty tomato sauce. Yemen Gate consistently delivers authentic and satisfying meals, never disappointing.",

        review: "What a treat and what a gem of a place to have in Ottawa. This meal took me back to the meals I had whilst desert camping in Kuwait. I was so happy with my meal. I had the lamb and rice and selected an extra hot sauce as it is a perfect accompaniment. I also splurged and had their dessert item and I can say the Maasoub is unlike any dessert I’ve had before. If you haven’t tried it, you MUST.",
